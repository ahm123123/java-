    <h3>Temperature is a measure of the degree of hotness or coldness of an object or a substance, with respect to a standard value. It is a physical quantity that is commonly measured using various scales, such as Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K). In thermodynamics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles in a system, where higher temperatures indicate that the particles are moving more rapidly, and lower temperatures indicate that they are moving more slowly. Temperature plays a critical role in many natural and technological processes, and is an essential parameter in fields such as physics, chemistry, engineering, and meteorology.</h3>
